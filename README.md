# Amazon-Q-n-Quicksight
Data Stories using Amazon Quicksight and Amazon Q in just 5 min

Upload the data in Quicksight with 
SPICE(Superfast Parallel In-memory Calculation Engine)

Advantages
1) Your analytical queries process faster.

2) You don't need to wait for a direct query to process.

3) Data stored in SPICE can be reused multiple times without incurring additional costs. If you use a data source that charges per query, you're charged for querying the data when you first create the dataset and later when you refresh the dataset.

SPICE capacity is allocated separately for each AWS Region. Default SPICE capacity is automatically allocated to your home AWS Region. For each AWS account, SPICE capacity is shared by all the people using QuickSight in a single AWS Region. The other AWS Regions have no SPICE capacity unless you choose to purchase some. QuickSight administrators can view how much SPICE capacity you have in each AWS Region and how much of it is currently in use.

Used Cases :
1) Using Snowflake connector for Food-truck order data analysis for business review
2) Using S3 storage People Overview Dataset analysis for Human Capital Insights


Steps:
1) Ingest / Load Data
2) Automatic appropriate and excellent Analysis is done and available to build dashboard which you can be modified if needed
